### Getting started locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the file src/extension.ts and press F5. This will opena new VSC window with a debugger attached, where you can test your code.

### Creating an Issue

Before **creating** an Issue please follow these steps:

1. search existing Issues before creating a new issue (has someone raised this already)
2. if it doesn't exist create a new issue giving as much context as possible
3. if you wish to work on the Issue please check the relative checkbox

### Working on an Issue

Before working on an existing Issue please follow these steps:

1. comment asking for the issue to be assigned to you
2. after the Issue is assigned to you, you can start working on it
3. **only** start working on this Issue (and open a Pull Request) when it has been assigned to you.
4. when forking the issue, create a branch for your edits
5. please do **not** force push to your PR branch, this makes it very difficult to re-review - commits will be squashed when merged

### Pull requests

Remember, before opening a PR, to have an issue assigned to work on! If you have an idea but you don't find any issue for it, first open an issue and ask to have it assigned! This way you don't risk to work on something which is already being worked on or that isn't needed right now!
When the issue is assigned to you, you're welcome to start working on it, I'll be glad to merge it!
