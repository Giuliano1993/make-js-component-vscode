# Make JS component 
This is [Make Js Component](https://github.com/Giuliano1993/make-js-component) VS Code Extension.
This tool, just like its npx equivalent, removes the tedious component creation from your flow, adding the capability to create a brand new development-ready component right from your command Palette.
At the moment we support the following JS Frameworks:
- Vue
- React
- Angular
- Svelte
- Qwik
- Astro

## Commands

### Make Js Component
The basic command. It let you create a component, choosing the name and picking the framework

### Make Js Component - Detect Framework
Leave the framework choice to MJC, it will detect the framework you're using and will pick the correct component template for you.
