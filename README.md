# make-js-component-vscode 

This is the repo for the VS Code extension developed starting from [Make Js Component](https://github.com/Giuliano1993/make-js-component).
The core idea is to make it easier and more straight forward for developers creating new components each time.
Firts the npx command was born, if you haven't tried it yet, I invite you to do so.
But we can do better, for our developer fellas out there. We can make it easier and take the component creation to the next level.

Just a VS Code command palette away from here, you can have your next component for any framework you'd like.
